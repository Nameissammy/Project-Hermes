A yellow fruit with a peel, so grand, the banana is nature's treat at hand. Itâ€™s curved like a smile, a potassium boost, peel it quick, no time to roast. Slip on the peel, watch someone sway, "Banana peel, you ruined my day!". But eat the fruit and you'll be fine, banana goodness, truly divine. Monkeys adore it, that's plain to see, a banana's charm sets spirits free.
